ofxGeometry
-----------
Very very experimental geometry operations
addon for openFrameworks. Goals are to apply
operations such as smoothing, joining, splitting,
extruding, etc.. Basically a 3D modeller in code.

INSTALL (tested in Xcode 4)
===========================
1. clone this addon to your addons directory
2. create a new OF application (i.e. use a template or copy the empty example)
3. create a new group: ofxGeometry
4. add search path: ../../../addons/ofxGeometry/include/
5. add the static libs from the ofxGeometry/libs/ directory

EXAMPLE
=======
The example contains a rough example I used to test.
